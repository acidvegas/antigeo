# ANTI-GEO

This project is designed to utilize the legal requirements imposed on GEOIP providers by the General Data Protection Regulation *(GDPR)* and other privacy laws, compelling them to comply with data deletion and opt-out requests. The initiative's core strategy is to use a network of proxies to submit mass opt-out requests to a variety of GEOIP providers. This approach aims to significantly disrupt their global geolocation data coverage.

Given that these providers are legally obligated to honor such requests, the project seeks to exploit this mandate to diminish the comprehensiveness of their databases, thereby challenging the scope and reliability of their geolocation services. This is a legal and strategic method to critically affect the efficacy of GEOIP providers under the current privacy law framework.

## Why
This project is motivated by a desire to counteract the widespread and often unchecked collection of data by entities like WhiteOps and similar corporations. In a digital landscape where almost every interaction is tracked and monetized, the aggregation and sale of personal data have become commonplace, often without the explicit consent or awareness of individuals.

By targeting the primary sources of this data collection — GEOIP providers — the project aims to create a significant disruption in the data supply chain. The rationale is that by obstructing one of the key sources of geolocation data, we can induce a domino effect, leading to broader chaos and confusion within the data collection and analytics ecosystem.

This initiative serves as a form of digital protest against the pervasive surveillance and data exploitation practices, emphasizing the power of collective action in challenging and destabilizing established data-centric corporate structures.

**TLDR;** get fucking fucked white-ops
